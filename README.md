## How to install and upload chosen game to watch

The easiest way:
1) Download Visual Studio >2019 and open the Visual Studio file from `/src`. By doing that all libraries will be uploaded and prepared for you upfront.
2) Upload your favourite game saved in [chess notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)). The default one playing (in case you won't upload your own) is one of the bests plays from [Magnus Carlsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Carlsen) ever!
3) Watch and enjoy!
